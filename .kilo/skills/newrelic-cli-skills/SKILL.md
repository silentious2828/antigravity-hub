# New Relic CLI Skills

## Quick Decision Tree

**Performance issue reported?** → [`apm/SKILL.md`](apm/SKILL.md)
**Need to query data with NRQL?** → [`nrql/SKILL.md`](nrql/SKILL.md)
**Recording a deployment?** → [`deployments/SKILL.md`](deployments/SKILL.md)
**Alert management?** → [`alerts/SKILL.md`](alerts/SKILL.md)
**Infrastructure/host issues?** → [`infrastructure/SKILL.md`](infrastructure/SKILL.md)
**Agent not reporting?** → [`diagnostics/SKILL.md`](diagnostics/SKILL.md)

## Setup & Auth

```bash
# Install (manual or package manager)
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install newrelic-cli

# Or manually download a release archive from:
# https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/releases
# Extract it, place the `newrelic` binary on your PATH, then verify with:
newrelic --version

# Configure profile
newrelic profile add \
  --profile default \
  --apiKey $NEW_RELIC_API_KEY \
  --accountId $NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID \
  --region US   # or EU

newrelic profile default --profile default

# Verify
newrelic profile list
```

---

## Common One-Liners

```bash
# Search for an entity by name
newrelic entity search --name "my-app"

# Run a NRQL query
newrelic nrql query --accountId $NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID \
  --query "SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='my-app' SINCE 1 hour ago"

# Record a deployment
newrelic apm deployment create \
  --applicationId <APP_ID> \
  --revision "v1.2.3" \
  --description "Feature: user auth"

# Run diagnostics
newrelic diagnose run
```

---

## Entity Reference

Find entity GUIDs (needed for API calls and deployment markers):

```bash
# List all APM apps
newrelic entity search --name "" --type APPLICATION --domain APM

# Get specific entity details
newrelic entity get --guid <GUID>

# List all hosts
newrelic entity search --name "" --type HOST
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `NEW_RELIC_API_KEY` | User key (NRAK-...) |
| `NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID` | Numeric account ID |
| `NEW_RELIC_REGION` | `US` or `EU` |

## Sub-Skills

| Sub-skill | When to use |
|---|---|
| [`apm/`](apm/SKILL.md) | Performance triage, slow transactions, error analysis |
| [`nrql/`](nrql/SKILL.md) | Custom queries, dashboards, ad-hoc data exploration |
| [`deployments/`](deployments/SKILL.md) | Mark releases, correlate deploys with performance |
| [`alerts/`](alerts/SKILL.md) | Alert policies, conditions, notification channels |
| [`infrastructure/`](infrastructure/SKILL.md) | Host metrics, CPU/memory, process monitoring |
| [`diagnostics/`](diagnostics/SKILL.md) | Agent health, config validation, connectivity |

## Bundled Guidance

The package contains the six sub-skills listed above. It does not bundle helper scripts or a separate references directory. Use the inline CLI and NRQL examples in the relevant sub-skill, inspect `newrelic --help` for the installed CLI version, and adapt commands to the user's account and region.
